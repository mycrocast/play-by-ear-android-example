Integration of the SDK</h2><p class="paragraph">The first thing you need to do to use the SDK in your application is to create an instance of the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-s-d-k/index.html">PlayByEarSDK</a> as this class contains all classes you will need to integrate the functionality of the SDK.</p><p class="paragraph">Use the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.data/-play-by-ear-s-d-k-builder/index.html">PlayByEarSDKBuilder</a> to create an instance of the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-s-d-k/index.html">PlayByEarSDK</a>. Hold the reference to this created instance for the whole lifetime of your application because you should only create it once and reuse it.</p><p class="paragraph">To create the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.data/-play-by-ear-s-d-k-builder/index.html">PlayByEarSDKBuilder</a> you need to create an implementation of the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-s-d-k-credentials/index.html">PlayByEarSDKCredentials</a> interface as well as an implementation of the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.logger/-play-by-ear-logger/index.html">PlayByEarLogger</a> and an instance of SharedPreferences. The last one is only used to store a unique identifier of the user of the PlayByEarSDK and therefore your application, as this allows us to identify reccurring users.</p><br><blockquote class="quotation"><p class="paragraph"><strong><i>INFORMATION</i></strong> <br> The generation of the user identifier is completely randomized in the backend of PlayByEar and does not include any critical or sensitive information about the user, their mobile phone nor your application.</p></blockquote><br><p class="paragraph">The <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-s-d-k-credentials/index.html">PlayByEarSDKCredentials</a> is needed to identify your application and to match the live audio-broadcasts of the streamers of your club, which started streaming via the <a href="https://studio.mycrocast.de/mycrocast/ng/login/streamer">mycrocast-studio website</a>. Every club has a unique token, so you will only get informed about livestreams of your club.</p><br><blockquote class="quotation"><p class="paragraph"><strong><i>INFORMATION</i></strong> <br> You will get your unique token from us after the registration. Alternative it can be found in the admin panel of your club in the mycrocast-studio website.</p></blockquote><br><p class="paragraph">The <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.logger/-play-by-ear-logger/index.html">PlayByEarLogger</a> will give you additional information about the processes in the sdk itself like information, warnings and errors. While the information logs are just for understanding and tracking the process of the SDK, warnings may guide you to potential pitfalls and errors will occur only when an exception was thrown inside the SDK.</p><br><blockquote class="quotation"><p class="paragraph"><strong><i>INFORMATION</i></strong> <br> Even if an exception was thrown the SDK itself will not crash. But it will help us a lot if you inform us if you encounter an error and how to reproduce it.</p></blockquote><br><p class="paragraph">We would strongly advise to use a dependency injection library for the integration of the PlayByEarSDK, e.g. with <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android">Dagger-Hilt</a> like in the <a href="https://github.com/mycrocast/play-by-ear-android-example">example project</a>. But it is also possible to setup the sdk in your custom application class or in a completely seperate singleton, if you want. But make sure you only create an instance once and reuse it.</p><br><h2 class="">4. Important interfaces</h2><p class="paragraph">Before describing how to use the SDK and its interfaces in more detail, lets take a look to the core interfaces you will stumble on.</p><h3 class="">PlayByEarLivestream</h3><p class="paragraph">The <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">PlayByEarLivestream</a> represents a single live audio broadcast which was started by a streamer in mycrocast-studio. It holds every information about a single audio-broadcast you will need, e.g a unique token, the title and language of the broadcast. (For more detail see the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">documentation</a>)</p><h3 class="">PlayByEarLanguage</h3><p class="paragraph">The <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-language/index.html">PlayByEarLanguage</a> holds information about the language of a <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">PlayByEarLivestream</a>. The selected language is represented in three different ways:</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph">The english name of the language,</p></li><li><p class="paragraph">the code of the language, according to the <a href="https://localizely.com/iso-639-1-list/">ISO 639-1</a>,</p></li><li><p class="paragraph">the native representation, how the language itself is called in the specific language (e.g. 'Deutsch' for German or 'Français' for French.</p></li></ul><br><h2 class="">5. Usage of the SDK</h2><p class="paragraph">After the setup and the configuration of the SDK in the first chapter, this one describes the intended way of using the SDK. For the following steps you need to use the interfaces given to you via the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-s-d-k/index.html">PlayByEarSDK</a>.</p><p class="paragraph">The first thing you need to do is to use the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/index.html">PlayByEarConnection</a> to connect to the backend of PlayByEar. If this succeeds you should load all currently active <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreams</a> via the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.livestream.loader.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream-loader/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreamLoader</a>. This will change the list of active <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreams</a> in the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.livestream.container.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream-container/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreamContainer</a>. If a user selects an active <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">PlayByEarLivestream</a> to play, you should start a Foreground Service to play the audio-broadcast of this livestream via the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.livestream.player.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream-player/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreamPlayer</a>, which can be created with the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.livestream.player.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream-player/-factory/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreamPlayer.Factory</a>.</p><h3 class="">Establishing a connection and observing changes</h3><p class="paragraph">For establishing a connection as well as observing the connection state use <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/index.html">PlayByEarConnection</a>. At the start before the first connection attempt the initial value of <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/current-state.html">currentState</a> will be <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/-state/-n-e-w/index.html">NEW</a>. This is the perfect time to try establishing a connection to the PlayByEar backend via <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/connect.html">connect</a>. You will need an active network connection for this to succeed. While trying to establishing a connection, the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/current-state.html">currentState</a> changes to <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/-state/-c-o-n-n-e-c-t-i-n-g/index.html">CONNECTING</a>.

Of course you can try to establish a connection again either via <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/connect.html">connect</a> or <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/reconnect.html">reconnect</a>.</p><p class="paragraph">If the connection attempt succeeds, you can load all currently active <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.core.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreams</a> as described below.</p><p class="paragraph">If you established a connection once it is possible that this connection is lost after some time. This is exactle the case if the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/current-state.html">currentState</a> changes from <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/-state/-c-o-n-n-e-c-t-e-d/index.html">CONNECTED</a> to <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/-state/-d-i-s-c-o-n-n-e-c-t-e-d/index.html">DISCONNECTED</a>. Here you need to implement a reconnect use case (again via <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/connect.html">connect</a> or <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.connection.domain/-play-by-ear-connection/reconnect.html">reconnect</a>) according to your specifications. We would advise you to reconnect on demand (e.g. the user has a reconnect button) if no livestream is currently playing and if one is playing the application should try to reconnect in a timely manner (see the <a href="https://github.com/mycrocast/play-by-ear-android-example">example application</a>).</p><br><blockquote class="quotation"><p class="paragraph"><strong><i>INFROMATION</i></strong> <br> While the SDK is not connected, the following requests will fail:</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph">PlayByEarLivestreamLoader: load</p></li><li><p class="paragraph">PlayByEarLivestreamPlayer: play</p></li></ul><p class="paragraph">If a request fails, the SDK will log it as an error in your provided <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.logger/-play-by-ear-logger/index.html">PlayByEarLogger</a>.</p></blockquote><br><h3 class="">Loading and observing PlayByEarLivestream changes</h3><p class="paragraph">After establishing a connection to the PlayByEar backend you can request all currently active live broadcasts via the <a href="-play-by-ear-s-d-k/de.mycrocast.android.play_by_ear.sdk.livestream.loader.domain/-play-by-ear-livestream-loader/index.html">PlayByEarLivestreamLoader</a>.
